FuelConsumption
Linear Regression used for Analysis


In this problem we have to detect the fuel consumption of the car which has not been build till now. By the help of historical data we are going to predict the Co2Emission by the new car based on the various factor. In this code I will be using simple linear regression. The code for multiple linear regression will be uploaded soon.
